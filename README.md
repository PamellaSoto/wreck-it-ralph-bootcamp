## 📌 About the Project

This project was created during the **"Building a Wreck-It Ralph Game with JavaScript"** bootcamp on [DIO (Digital Innovation One)](https://www.dio.me/). The goal of the game is to click on Ralph as he appears in different panels. This project helped reinforce concepts in **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **basic game logic** using JavaScript.
